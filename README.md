# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. I built it to keep all my projects, contact info, and technical skills in one place.

## What’s inside
- **Intro:** intro section with a quick summary.
- **About:** Education and skills tabs.
- **Projects:** Featured Final Year Project plus other web apps.
- **Contact:** Links and a working form.

## Running the project
- **Live Demo:** [View here](https://c-tariq.github.io/MyPortfolio/)
- **Local Preview:** Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Notes
- **Styles:** Custom CSS in `style.css`.
- **Logic:** `script.js` handles the tabs, mobile menu, and form submission.
